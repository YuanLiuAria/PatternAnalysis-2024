# COMP3710 Pattern Recognition Report

## Question 2: Facebook Graph Data Analysis is attempted 

### Algorithm Description
This repo contain a multi-layer GNN model to carry out a semi supervised miltu-class node classfication using Facebook Large Page-Page Network dataset

### How It Works 

### File Overview
The following file can be find:
- `dataset.py`-  data loader for the dataset facebook_large folder
- `modules.py`- GNN model code
- `train.py`- training process
- `predict.py`- testing process



### Data Files
- `musae_facebook_features.json`: Contains node features
- `musae_facebook_edges.csv`: Contains edges between nodes
- `musae_facebook_target.csv`: Contains node labels

### Dependencies
This project contains following dependenies:
